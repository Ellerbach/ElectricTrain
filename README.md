Managing old electric train with RaspberryPi running Windows 10 IoT Core

This project allow to pilot an old traditional train thru a Raspberry PI running Windows 10 IoT Core. The code has 3 core parts:
- Managing the switches: this is done thru SPI and electronic
- Managing the lights and stops: this is done as well thru SPI and electronics
- Managing the speed and direction of the trains: this is done thru an Arudino which delivered PWM to H-Bridge. The ardino is connected thu serial port to the Raspberry

All electronic schemas to be published later on.
